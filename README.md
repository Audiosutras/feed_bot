### Deployment

This project utilizes [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/managing-github-packages-using-github-actions-workflows/publishing-and-installing-a-package-with-github-actions#publishing-a-package-using-an-action) for deploying a production ready docker container to the github container registry. For more information see [working with the container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

To push a new container to github packages merge code into the `release` branch.
